Listen up 

This is going to be a tough one. 
I will ask you so so many times, but we will get there i can feel it. 


The task: 
Write a function in the service/routines.go file

GetReleavantRoutines(user_id) DisplayRoutine



Okay so it must return a mix of Concrete routines from the Routines table that the user is working on that can still be worked on.


And then it must mix that with Blueprint Routines that are relevant today. 



Example:

It is monday morning (7:00)
A routine from the routines table exists. It's recurrence is weekday and we are still within the deadline of created and to_be_completed_by. So we include this routine.

There are no more relevant routines in the concrete routines table 

BUT there are two blueprint routines that are relevant for today. 
The afternoon and evening routines. Their recurrence match that today is a weekday. 


I may have forgot tons of details. We will refine.

Edit: 
I have already made an attempt with 

func (s *RoutineService) GetRoutinesToDisplay(userID int64) ([]models.DisplayableRoutine, error) {

You can remove / refactor the function and the return struct as much as you like
