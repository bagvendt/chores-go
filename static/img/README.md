# Image Placeholders

In a real application, this directory would contain actual image files (PNG, SVG, etc.) for the chores and shop items.

For the purposes of this demo, we're using references to images that don't exist. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Create/obtain actual images for each chore and shop item
2. Place them in this directory
3. Reference them correctly in the data.js file
